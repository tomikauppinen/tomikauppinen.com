From childhood, my passions spanned reading, arts, music, science, and travel, fueling diverse studies from computer science and philosophy to film theory and mathematics. My first real career was five+ years in data visualization and online business bolstered by eclectic experiences, like working in Paris to learn French and travelling to see the world.\nAmidst industry work, I gravitated toward writing and research, pursuing a PhD in intelligent systems. My academic journey, spanning cognitive systems, AI, visual communication, spatial information, and online learning, covers 30+ countries via speeches, projects and collaborations. Passion drives me at the nexus of exploration, research, design, and education, leveraging storytelling, AR, and human interactions, with a creative and open attitude, yet also critical eye on AI's impact.\nHost of the Cloud Reachers podcast, and author of HUMAN and co-editor of 'Design Education Across Disciplines,' my hobbies merge cyber-physical pursuits with literature, photography, physical exercises \u0026amp; sports and film. Through my books, workshops, projects, teaching, lab, and keynotes, I aspire to open doors for experiencing engaging adventures, fostering invaluable learning experiences, facing philosophical questions, and contributing to designing a world that is both exhilarating and human.\n","link":"https://tomikauppinen.com/about/","section":"","tags":null,"title":"About Tomi Kauppinen"},{"body":"For interviews, keynotes, collaborations and book signing please contact me at tomi.j.kauppinen@gmail.com\n","link":"https://tomikauppinen.com/contact/","section":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact"},{"body":"HUMAN In this world full of open questions and uncertainty HUMAN is the story of people engaging to cope with what they perceive and experience.

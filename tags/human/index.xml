            I was so happy to join for an episode of EduTrends Podcast hosted by Jos√© &#39;Pepe&#39; Escamilla, Associate Director of The Institute for the Future of Education of Tec de Monterrey. We talked about the role of us human beings in this era of AI, my new book &amp;quot;HUMAN&amp;quot;, about cyber-physical learning and more.
